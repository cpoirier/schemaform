Schemaform is a high-level database programming DSL for Ruby, intended to greatly reduce the work needed to produce a performant back-end from a complex, normalized design. With Schemaform, you can:

* capture even your most complex structures, relationships, and processing quickly and concisely
* leave all the denormalization and performance-related tuning to the system
* never compose another line of SQL
* focus instead on making your software great.

Schemaform does for you the very work you would normally have to do by hand and intuition when taking a database-driven system from design to implementation.

See the [project wiki](https://github.com/cpoirier/schemaform/wiki) for more details.
